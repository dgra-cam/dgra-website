The Communities Team from South Cambs & Cambridge City Council have recently
published the date for the 2025 community forums.

These forums are open to the public, they aim at bringing together residents,
council agents and developers to discuss the progress of the developments. If
you want to raise concerns, or if you want to stay up-to-date with the latest
milestones, consider attending the community forums!

Darwin Green, along with Eddington, are covered by the **North West & West
Community Forums**. The dates for 2025 are:

- **6 March**; this was a hybrid meeting, both online and on-site at Darwin
  Green Community Room
- **12 June**
- **12 November**

The exact locations and times of the remaining meetings have not been published
as of this writing.
