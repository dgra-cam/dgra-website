More savings for some Darwin Green flat owners
{{% /imgproc %}}

Effective 1st January 2025, four of the first four blocks of appartments in
Darwin Green are no longer pay Ground Rent, and are not longer subject to
periodic Rent Review.

Owners who bought a flat directly from Barratt/David Wilson (now
Barratt-Redrow) in the Courtyard or the library and Plaza area have not been
paying Ground Rent; only the buyers of the first flats built in the Darwin
Green development were subject to it. The community took the matter to
Barratt-Redrow, arguing that is was unfair that only the owners who invested
early in the developement were charged with Ground Rent. The charge was
approximately Â£500 a year, and was likely to go up in a few years time.
