## Origin of the Names in Darwin Green

_Darwin Green_ is a reference to [Charles Darwin] (1809-1882), the famous
naturalist, geologist, and biologist. But do you know where the names of the
streets and buildings in the development come from? The builder company hasn't
published the origin of the names, but here's our guess:

Beagle Road

: [HMS _Beagle_][beagle] was the ship that carried Darwin around the world,
for a five-year trip that established the scientist's status as an eminent
geologist and played a key role in the formation of his theories on evolution.

Cornford Drive

: In 1909, [Francis Macdonald Cornford] (1874-1943), a scholar from Trinity
College in Cambridge, married the poet Frances Darwin, granddaughter of Charles
Darwin.

Darwin building

: A direct reference to [Charles Darwin]. Darwin had ties with Cambridge: he
studied at Christ College from 1828 to 1831 before leaving for his famous
voyage, and once returned he spent a few months (mid-December 1836 to early
March 1837) in Cambridge to arrange expert classification of his collections
while preparing his own research for publication.

Evolution Court

: Darwin was instrumental to the conception of the theory of [evolution].

Falmouth Avenue

: [Falmouth] is a town on the River Fal on the south coast of Cornwall. On 2nd
October 1836, HMS _Beagle_ anchored at Falmouth, thus ending [its second
trip][beagle-trip] and bringing back Darwin to England.

Falmouth Close

: See _Falmouth Avenue_.

Galton Road

: [Francis Galton] (1822-1911) was Darwin's half-cousin. He studied mathematics
at Trinity College in Cambridge, and is credited for ideas that became the
basis of [behavioural genetics].

Hawking building

: This is probably a reference to the theoretical physicist and cosmologist
[Stephen Hawking] (1942-2018), whose ashes were interred at Westminster Abbey,
between the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.

Henslow Crescent

: [John Stevens Henslow] (1796-1861) was an Anglican priest, botanist and
geologist, and Darwin's friend and academic advisor.

Horace Walk

: [Sir Horace Darwin] (1851–1928) was an engineer specializing in the design
and manufacture of precision scientific instruments, and the ninth child of
Charles Darwin. He was also a Fellow of Trinity College in Cambridge, and was
elected Mayor of the city between 1896 and 1897.

Lawrence Weaver Road

: [Sir Lawrence Weaver][lwww] (1876–1930) was an English architectural writer
and civil servant. He founded the National Institute of Agricultural Botany.
Lawrence Weaver Road predates the Darwin Green development, which is why that
the character has no ties with Darwin.

Lewis building

: This is a tricky name, because there's no apparent well-known relationship
between Darwin and anyone named Lewis. Based on the names of the neighbour
buildings (Hawking, Darwin, Newton), we suppose it could be a scientist and/or
an individual buried in Westminster Abbey. A good candidate would be [C. S.
Lewis][lewis] (1898-1963), writer, literary scholar, and theologian, who
authored _The Chronicles of Narnia_. He held a chair at Magdalene College in
Cambridge from 1954 to 1963, and was honoured, 50 years after his death, with a
memorial in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.

Newton building

: [Sir Isaac Newton] (1642-1727) was a scientist, whose legacy is too long to
list in this paragraph but includes the laws of motion and universal
gravitation. He was a fellow of Trinity College in Cambridge, and served twice
as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge. After his death he was
buried in Westminster Abbey, where Darwin later joined him.

Patagonia Way

: The southern end of South America, [Patagonia] is a region spreading over
Argentina and Chile. About his voyage aboard HMS _Beagle_, [Darwin
wrote][patagonia-journal]: "The object of the expedition was to complete the
survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826
to 1830-to survey the shores of Chile, Peru, and of some islands in the
Pacific-and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the World."

Plymouth Close

: On his second voyage, the one with Darwin on board, HMS _Beagle_ departed
from [Plymouth], a port city in Devon. The city was also the birth town of
[William Elford Leach] (1791-1836), a zoologist and marine biologist who paved
the way for Darwin's work.

Randal Way

: This may related to [Randal Keynes] (1948–2023), conservationist, author, and
great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin. Randal was born in Cambridge, and
authored a book about the relationship between Darwin and his daughter Annie.

Shrewsbury Road

: [Shrewsbury] is a town in Shropshire, and the birth town to Charles Darwin.

Wallace Way

: [Alfred Russel Wallace] (1823-1813) was a naturalist, explorer, geographer,
anthropologist, biologist, and illustrator. He was a friend to Darwin, and he
independently conceived the theory of evolution through natural selection,
which pushed Darwin to publish his book _On the Origin of Species_.

Wren House

: [Wrens] are birds, to be more accurate they're a family of small brown
passerine birds. During his voyage, Darwin collected a specimen that he
described as a Galápagos "wren", but turned out to be another closely allied
species of finch.
